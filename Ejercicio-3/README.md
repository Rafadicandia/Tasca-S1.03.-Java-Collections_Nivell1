## 📄Description - Exercise Statement

### Exercise 1

Create a class named **Month** with an attribute `name` (which will store the name of the month of the year). Add **11 Month objects** (each with a different attribute) to an **ArrayList**, excluding the object with the attribute "Agost" (**August**). Then, insert the "August" object in its correct position and demonstrate that the **ArrayList** maintains the correct order.

Convert the **ArrayList** from the previous exercise into a **HashSet** and ensure that it does not allow duplicates.

Iterate through the list using a **`for` loop** and an **`Iterator`**.

### Exercise 2

Create and populate a **`List<Integer>`**.

Create a second **`List<Integer>`** and insert the elements of the first list into the second one in **reverse order**.

Use **`ListIterator`** objects to read the elements from the first list and insert them into the second.

### Exercise 3

Given the file **`countries.txt`** (check the resources section) which contains countries and capitals. The program must read the file and store the data in a **`HashMap<String, String>`**. The program must ask for the user's name, and then display a country chosen **randomly** from the **HashMap**. The user must then type the name of the capital of that country. If the user answers correctly, they earn one point. This action is repeated **10 times**. Once the capitals of 10 random countries have been requested, the user's name and their final score must be saved to a file named **`classificacio.txt`**.
